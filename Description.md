# **Optimizing Neural Network Structures with Global Optimization Algorithms**

## **Objective**  
To design a framework that optimizes neural network architectures using global optimization algorithms and provides a web application for task management, visualization, and result analysis.

---

## **Scope**  
- Develop a backend system for implementing and running optimization algorithms.  
- Create a user-friendly web interface for:  
  - Configuring optimization tasks.  
  - Visualizing optimization progress.  
  - Managing datasets and results.  
- Combine advanced optimization features (e.g., early stopping, tree-based search) with machine learning techniques.

## **Phases of Work**

### **Phase 1: Literature Review**  
- Study global optimization algorithms (e.g., Genetic Algorithms, PSO, Bayesian Optimization).  
- Review Neural Architecture Search (NAS) methods and platforms like Microsoft NNI.  
- Define the problem statement.

### **Phase 2: Framework Design**  
- Design backend architecture for optimization algorithms and APIs.  
- Define frontend structure for the web interface.  
- Specify communication between backend and frontend using RESTful APIs or WebSockets.

### **Phase 3: Backend Development**  
- Implement optimization algorithms in Python (e.g., using PyTorch/TensorFlow).  
- Create RESTful APIs for managing tasks, progress, and results.  
- Incorporate early stopping and resource-efficient execution.

### **Phase 4: Web Application Development**  
- Develop a frontend using React.js or Vue.js.  
- Integrate with backend APIs for real-time updates and task management.  
- Include visualizations for optimization progress and results.

### **Phase 5: Experimentation and Validation**  
- Test the system on datasets like CIFAR-10 and MNIST.  
- Validate optimization algorithms and measure their performance.  
- Use the web interface to run and monitor experiments.

### **Phase 6: Documentation and Deployment**  
- Write technical documentation for the framework and web application.  
- Deploy the system on a cloud platform (e.g., AWS, Heroku).  
- Prepare a research paper detailing the results.
