## **Findings from Phase 1: Literature Review**  

### **1. Global Optimization Algorithms**  
Global optimization algorithms efficiently explore complex solution spaces. Key algorithms studied include:  
- **Genetic Algorithms (GA):**  
  Simulates natural selection using mutation, crossover, and selection to evolve solutions toward optimal neural network architectures.  
- **Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO):**  
  Models particles in a solution space, adjusting their positions based on individual and group experiences to find the optimum.  
- **Bayesian Optimization (BO):**  
  Uses a surrogate probabilistic model to guide searches for the best solutions with fewer evaluations, ideal for resource-intensive tasks like neural network training.  

### **2. Neural Architecture Search (NAS)**  
NAS automates the design of neural network architectures. Key insights include:  
- Techniques such as Reinforcement Learning, Evolutionary Algorithms, and Random Search are integral to NAS.  
- Tools like Microsoft NNI provide frameworks for experimenting with NAS, offering flexibility in applying different search strategies.  

### **3. Problem Statement**  
The primary challenge is integrating global optimization algorithms with NAS into a scalable and resource-efficient framework. This includes creating a web interface for intuitive task configuration, visualization, and analysis.  

### **4. Techniques for Optimization**  
- **Early Stopping:** Halts computations when further improvements become negligible.  
- **Tree-Based Search:** Narrows down promising regions in the solution space systematically.  
- **Resource Efficiency:** Optimizes time and computational resources, especially for large datasets and complex architectures.

## **Key Insights and Observations**  
- Global optimization techniques are well-suited for exploring vast, non-convex solution spaces, essential for NAS.  
- Existing NAS platforms lack user-friendly tools for task configuration and result analysis.  
- Cloud deployment will enhance accessibility and scalability for users.

## **Next Steps: Phase 2 â€“ Framework Design**  

In Phase 2, the focus will be on designing a scalable system architecture that bridges backend optimization processes with a responsive frontend.  

### **Tasks for Phase 2**  
1. **Backend Architecture Design:**  
   - Define the structure for implementing optimization algorithms and managing task execution.  
   - Determine communication protocols (e.g., RESTful APIs or WebSockets) for backend and frontend interaction.  
2. **Frontend Structure:**  
   - Design a web interface layout for task configuration, progress visualization, and result management.  
   - Utilize modern frameworks like React.js or Vue.js for a responsive UI.  
3. **Integration Plan:**  
   - Ensure seamless real-time updates and scalable interaction between backend and frontend systems.

## **Conclusion**  
Phase 1 established a strong theoretical foundation, clarifying the algorithms, techniques, and challenges involved. Moving forward, Phase 2 will focus on translating this understanding into a detailed system design, preparing for backend and frontend development.
